This is a bunch of drivel that I'm using to test the action I just wrote in drafts.  If (big if) successful then this will appear as a new blog post file in my OneDrive and I will be able to push it to the GitHub repo that holds the data for perfectpath.uk

If not successful then I have more work to do.

I just ran it once, the front matter wasn't quite right, so I've edited the script, deleted the file and am running the script again.

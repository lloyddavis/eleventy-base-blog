This is a bunch of drivel that I'm using to test the action I just wrote in drafts.  If (big if) successful then this will appear as a new blog post file in my OneDrive and I will be able to push it to the GitHub repo that holds the data for perfectpath.uk

If not successful then I have more work to do.

I just ran it once, the front matter wasn't quite right, so I've edited the script, deleted the file and am running the script again.

This is now a new post in a separate draft, which I've done later in the day (not much later, but later enough...!)

I hope it recognises that there is a file already here for today and that it simply appends these paragraphs to the existing file.

In future, these individual notes could also be tweets.  They should have an anchor tag too, so that you can link to an idea rather than just a day or a story, but yeah, future...

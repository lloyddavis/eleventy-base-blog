Let's see what this test blog post is like.

It's supposed to be a test blog post :)

So here's a [link to the church website](http://guildfordurc.org.uk)

And to the [blog I'm testing](https://perfectpath.uk) it's going to.


##  Going to a Wedding

Yesterday we went to the wedding of our lovely friend Kemi.  Kemi was a bridesmaid at our wedding, Laura has known her since they were 11, starting at Woldingham, so yeah, like 28 years. It was a big African affair, but as Kemi's dad acknowledged also hugely multicultural, there were people from all over the world.

It was in the countryside south of Reading.  But now I realise I'm getting sucked into telling the story instead of y'know doing a test...

How do you **show** the end of a story/article?  Is it a line like that? How does an article _become_ one? I mean, if I wanted to make the wedding story into a page, but not until after I'd finished writing everything did I realise that's what it was?  I guess you just start talking about something new.  Anyway the way it gets rendered on the home page is that a heading becomes a link to a page with that name, you can go see it alone and link to it, but  on the home page it (and every other messy para) gets shown in a stream.  It makes sense when you read it anyway.

---

And how to create anchors for every para?  That might be in the eleventy docs.

Oh yeah and for image, use a flickr embed rather than markdown, although it would be good to be able to host some images on the site, need to check 11ty/netflify docs for that.

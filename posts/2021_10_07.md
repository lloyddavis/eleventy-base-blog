It's like all this started with [Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management), you know.  That's what I was trying to do at the end of the [Audit Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/audit-commission) time.  Trying to find a way to hold all of that stuff in my head and make sense of it, and knowing that I couldn't actually hold it in my head, but not knowing what else to do with it.

So it came out in [a blog](https://perfectpath.co.uk/2004/09/13/what-i-remembered-in-the-holidays/).

But the trouble with that is that, after a while, people see your poor little unworked thought and they pounce on it and want to talk about it.  And add references and related thoughts they've had and then suddenly something that was just a way of you making a note on your life and thinking *today* just today, unevolved, unpolished, not finished, im-fucking-perfect, has all of this [[attention]].  And then [[other people's attention grabs your attention]] and then they walk away and you're left with what? a small idea, a bunch of possibly useful, possibly not useful links and threads and untidy mess and no capacity left to deal with it.  

And then you just try to start again tomorrow, but a) you've got all this [[cognitive overload]] of yesterday's [[conversations]] and b) you know that it's all going to happen all over again.  So [[why bother?]] 

That's why I look for ways to [[blog like there's nobody reading]] because, from the start, the attention was simultaneously an unwanted distraction *and* attention from others that I desperately craved.
